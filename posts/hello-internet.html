		<h1>Hello Internet</h1>
		<p class="postheader">2024/11/13</p>
		<p>
			Hi! I'd love to write something interesting here, but I think I
			need to start with <em>something</em>, irrespective of its quality. 
		</p>
		<p>
			So, even though right now seems like just about the worst of times
			to do <em>anything</em>, I'll throw something &mdash; this &mdash;
			out there. Hopefully I'll follow it up with something more
			interesting this or next week.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've been reading tech blogs of all sorts for a few years now,
			finding them a great source of entertainment as well as all kinds
			of knowledge, reaching from
			<a href="https://danluu.com/">Dan Luu's</a> big-picture ideas to
			such amazing programming arcana as can be found on Raymond Chen's
			<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">The Old New Thing</a>
			(of which I have admittedly read every single post to date other
			than the Seattle Symphony subscription season entries. That's quite
			a few posts).
		</p>
		<p>
			Recently I have found myself coding some code and ideating some
			ideas that I believe might benefit from a more informal type of
			write-up than the coding I'm used to. I'd like to weigh their
			merits and demerits and, more importantly, make any aspects that
			are currently lacking clarity explicit to myself, which will
			hopefully provide a better framework for my mental tinkering. <br>
			Writing in a blog-structured format seems like a good way to
			achieve this.
		</p>
		<p>
			This blog then is not an attempt to do what all those technical
			bloggers whose articles I find so much joy in do so well. <br>
			Instead, at least for now, my intended audience is limited to me,
			myself, and only me.
			If anyone happens to find something I write helpful or even
			interesting, that'll be an &mdash; admittedly significant &mdash;
			bonus.
		</p>
		<p>
			This means that you can look forward to articles on the stuff I do
			from day to day as part of my hobby &mdash; programming.
			This currently includes programming language design, low-level
			bit-fiddling and hopefully some GPU-work in the not-so-distant
			future.
		</p>
		<p>
			P.S. To the dearly beloved aforementioned target audience. <br>
			You have read about how many blogs are just one single post, just
			like this one. And thought about how likely even more still fell
			short of even that milestone &mdash; which is why you're writing
			this in the first place. <br>
			As such, post something. This week. <br>
			If you find yourself strapped for time or (more likely) will, make
			it something quick, something simple &mdash; maybe an introductory
			braindump on whatever-you-feel-like when the time comes.
		</p>
		<p id="ps-deadline">
			But do it <em>this week</em> (Before sunday, the 17<sup>th</sup>
			of November, 2024, 23:59 GMT+1, that is).
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, <span class="code"><str>"Hello, Internet"</str></span> (Hehe,
			silly simple code highlighting).
